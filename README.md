  <h1> Dimensionality Reduction

  <h2> --Laplacian eigenmaps
  </h2>
  <p> High-dimensional data is difficult to interpret. One approach to simplification is to assume that the data lie on an embedded non-linear manifold. If the manifold is of low enough dimension, the data can be visualized in the low-dimensional space.Laplacian eigenmaps uses spectral techniques to perform dimensionality reduction. It builds a graph from neighborhood information of the data set. Each data points serves as a node on the graph and connectivity between nodes is governed by the proximity of neighboring points. The graph thus generated can be considered as a discrete approximation of the low-dimensional manifold on the high-dimensional space.
